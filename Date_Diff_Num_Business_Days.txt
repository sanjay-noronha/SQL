
Problem: 
* This is a T-SQL problem
* Calculate the number of business days between 2 dates i.e. exclude Weekends

Note:
* You will got an overview of the various date functions in T-SQL


--- Convert(): Convert a string to date using dd/mm/yyyy format
-- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15
SELECT CONVERT(DATE, '03/01/2022', 103)

--DATEPART(): You have to note the difference between :
--1. d: day of the month
--2. dy: day of year
--3. dw: day of week. Sunday = 1 Etc
--4. ww,wk : week number, 1-52
SELECT DATEPART(wk, CONVERT(DATE, '23/01/2022', 103))

--DATEDIFF()
-- d: difference in days, excluding the end date
-- ww, wk: calculates the number of times a date range contains dates that represent pairs of Saturdays and Sundays. Includes both date values
-- Reference: https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/calculating-work-days
SELECT DATEDIFF(ww, CONVERT(DATE, '06/02/2022', 103), CONVERT(DATE, '12/02/2022', 103))	

-- Test cases: A combination of Sat-Sun makes a week
-- Monday to Friday - Pass
-- Monday to Monday - Pass
-- Saturday to Sunday - Pass
-- Sunday to Friday - Pass
-- Sunday to Saturday - Pass
-- Saturday to Saturday - Pass
-- Saturday to Sunday - Pass
BEGIN

	DECLARE @StartDate DATE = CONVERT(DATE, '06/02/2022', 103)
	DECLARE @EndDate   DATE = CONVERT(DATE, '11/02/2022', 103)

	SELECT
	   (DATEDIFF(dd, @StartDate, @EndDate) + 1) -- including the end date
	  -(DATEDIFF(wk, @StartDate, @EndDate) * 2) --automatically includes the end date. Multiply by 2 since 2 days
	  -(CASE WHEN DATENAME(dw, @StartDate) = 'Sunday' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) --exclude the Sunday
	  -(CASE WHEN DATENAME(dw, @EndDate) = 'Saturday' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) -- exclude the Saturday
